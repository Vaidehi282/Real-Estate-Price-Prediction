# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

This project involves predicting real estate prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. The prediction model was developed using machine learning techniques and provides a user-friendly web interface to input property details and get an estimated price.

## Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize data for better model performance.
- **Modeling:** Implemented and trained various machine learning models,to predict property prices. The final model was chosen based on performance metrics.
- **Web Interface:** Developed a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the prediction model. Users can select the location, input the area, BHK, and number of bathrooms to get real-time price predictions.
- **API Integration:** The web application communicates with the machine learning model hosted on a server via an API, allowing for seamless integration between the frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used:

- **Python** for data analysis and machine learning model development.
- **Scikit-Learn** for model implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend development.
- **Flask** for the backend and API creation.
